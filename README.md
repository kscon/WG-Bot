# Telegram WG Bot

Commit history was deleted due to data protection (contained sensitive data) and transfer to github.

This bot does handle the cleaning schedule and money/debt history between a number of defined people in a shared appartemnt. This project is rather old, but should run out of the box with the latest python. Change the data in the .txt files accordingly.

For questions, refer to me.
